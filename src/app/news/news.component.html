          how much they cost and how you can buy one. Here's what you need to know about their new features, design, price & tech specs.
          Apple has, after many rumours and some last-minute leaks, unveiled its iPhones for 2018. There are three upgrade choices this year: the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, which  went on sale at Apple Stores around the globe on the morning of Friday 21 September.
          However, there are already reports suggesting that there may be issues with LTE and WiFi connectivity. We've also seen reports that suggest that the new iPhones are applying a filter to make selfies look better and people aren't pleased with the results, read about Beautygate below. 
          In addition to the XS and XS Max is the iPhone XR, which won't go on sale until 26 October, with pre-orders starting on 19 October.</p>

        <p style="text-align:center; padding: 30px 0px; font-size:large;">Now in its fourth iteration, the Apple Watch is going from strength
           to strength. It's become a core part of Apple's device lineup, and is undoubtedly the king of the smartwatch market.
            Still, that comes with a price - quite literally, as the Apple Watch is undeniably expensive unless you can find it
             under a discount. 
          Here, we share the best Apple Watch deals for the Series 3 as well as the new Series 4.
            The Series 4 is the latest Watch model, unveiled on 12 September 2018 and made available to pre-order on 14 September. It hit the shelves on 21 September, so is available to buy online and in stores now. </p>

        <p style="text-align:center; padding: 30px 0px; font-size:large;"> Google has given each of its new phones a larger screen without 
          making the phones appreciably larger. The Pixel 3 has a 5.5 inch screen, up from 5in on the Pixel 2, while the Pixel 3 XL 
          is now 6.3in, up from 6in for the Pixel 2 XL The difference between the Pixel 2 and Pixel 3 is especially noticeable 
          as the 2 had notoriously chunky bezels compared to most phones. The Pixel 3 XL stands out because it has a notch, while 
          the standard Pixel 3 doesn’t. A speaker on the bottom edge of the XL model means it doesn’t quite achieve the ‘nothing but 
          screen’ look of the iPhone XS, so it’s 
          arguable how much of the extra 0.3in of screen on the XL is usable. </p>
